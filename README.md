# Friends-of-Scott-Livingston
This is a repository for the Friends of Scott Livingston project


Current Objective: use Livingston's 55k contacts and find people who should talk to one another.

The contact list includes a phone number, email, name, and brief description.

We are using the "grandma" approach, meaning that the contacts should not have to fill out any forms. Using the information we have in-house, we will create the meetings without any work on their part. Perhaps afterward they can rate the meeting to help improve our algorithm.

Current task:

Use the description of each person and make a word ranking. Manually remove nondescriptive words such as "the." Then, using the top descriptive words, link people together who have that word in their description.

We can also try manually choosing descriptive words from the word rank instead of removing nondescriptive words.
